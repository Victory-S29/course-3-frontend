                    <p class="story-section--article__text">J. Robert Oppenheimer, in full Julius Robert Oppenheimer,
                        (born
                        April 22, 1904, New York, New York,
                        U.S.—died February 18, 1967, Princeton, New Jersey), American theoretical physicist and science
                        administrator, noted as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943–45) during development of
                        the
                        atomic bomb and as director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1947–66).
                        Accusations of
                        disloyalty led to a government hearing that resulted in the loss of his security clearance and
                        of
                        his position as adviser to the highest echelons of the U.S. government. The case became a cause
                        célèbre in the world of science because of its implications concerning political and moral
                        issues
                        relating to the role of scientists in government.<br>
                        <span class="story-section--article__text--subparagraph">Oppenheimer and the Manhattan
                            Project</span> <br>The rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany stirred
                        his first interest in politics. In 1936 he sided with the republic during the Civil War in
                        Spain,
                        where he became acquainted with communist students. Although his father’s death in 1937 left
                        Oppenheimer a fortune that allowed him to subsidize anti-fascist organizations, the tragic
                        suffering
                        inflicted by Joseph Stalin on Russian scientists led him to withdraw his associations with the
                        Communist Party—in fact, he never joined the party—and at the same time reinforced in him a
                        liberal
                        democratic philosophy. In 1939, Oppenheimer began an affair with Katharine Puening, a graduate
                        student in botany at the University of California, Los Angeles. Puening divorced her husband and
                        married Oppenheimer in 1940.<br>
                        After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939, the physicists Albert Einstein, Leo
                        Szilard,
                        and Eugene Wigner warned the U.S. government of the danger threatening all of humanity if the
                        Nazis
                        should be the first to make a nuclear bomb. Oppenheimer then began to seek a process for the
                        separation of uranium-235 from natural uranium and to determine the critical mass of uranium
                        required to make such a bomb. In August 1942 the U.S. Army was given the responsibility of
                        organizing the efforts of British and U.S. physicists to seek a way to harness nuclear energy
                        for
                        military purposes, an effort that became known as the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer was
                        instructed
                        to establish and administer a laboratory to carry out this assignment. In 1943 he chose the
                        plateau
                        of Los Alamos, near Santa Fe, New Mexico<br>
                        For reasons that have not been made clear, Oppenheimer in 1942 initiated discussions with
                        military
                        security agents that culminated with the implication that some of his friends and acquaintances
                        were
                        agents of the Soviet government. This led to the dismissal of a personal friend on the faculty
                        at
                        the University of California. In a 1954 security hearing, he described his contribution to those
                        discussions as “a tissue of lies.”<br>
                        The joint effort of outstanding scientists at Los Alamos culminated in the first nuclear
                        explosion,
                        on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity Site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, after the surrender of
                        Germany.
                        In October of the same year, Oppenheimer resigned his post. In 1947 he became head of the
                        Institute
                        for Advanced Study and served from 1947 until 1952 as chairman of the General Advisory Committee
                        of
                        the Atomic Energy Commission, which in October 1949 opposed development of the hydrogen bomb.

                        <span class="story-section--article__text--subparagraph">Oppenheimer’s legacy</span><br>
                        In 1963 U.S. Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award of the
                        Atomic
                        Energy Commission. Oppenheimer retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1966 and died of
                        throat cancer the following year. In 2014, 60 years after the proceedings that effectively ended
                        Oppenheimer’s career, the U.S. Department of Energy released the full, declassified transcript
                        of
                        the hearing. While many of the details were already known, the newly released material bolstered
                        Oppenheimer’s assertions of loyalty and reinforced the perception that a brilliant scientist had
                        been brought low by a bureaucratic cocktail of professional jealousy and McCarthyism. In 2022
                        the
                        Department of Energy formally vacated the revocation of Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Energy
                        Secretary Jennifer Granholm claimed that the “bias and unfairness” of a “flawed process” had led
                        to
                        his exile from the nuclear establishment. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023), cast Cillian
                        Murphy in the title role of a film that explored Oppenheimer’s role in the development of the
                        atomic
                        bomb and the events that led to the 1954 security hearing.
